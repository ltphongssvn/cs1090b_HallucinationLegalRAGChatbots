# Reducing Hallucination in Legal RAG Chatbots
### A Comparative Study of Retrieval Architectures: From Non-Neural Baselines to Transformer-Based Deep Learning
[![CI](https://github.com/ltphongssvn/cs1090b_HallucinationLegalRAGChatbots/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ltphongssvn/cs1090b_HallucinationLegalRAGChatbots/actions/workflows/ci.yml)
- **Author:** Alex Oort Alonso, Allan Korir, PHONG LE, and Brit Biddle
- **Course:** COMPSCI 1090B: Data Science 2: Advanced Topics in Data Science — Harvard University
- **Cluster node:** 4× NVIDIA L4/A10G (23,034 MiB each) | SLURM job allocation: 1× NVIDIA L4/A10G visible to PyTorch via `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` | PyTorch build: torch 2.0.1+cu117 (node driver: CUDA 12.8) | Python 3.11.9
> - Although compute nodes physically contain 4× NVIDIA L4/A10G GPUs, student jobs are allocated a
> single GPU by the SLURM scheduler. `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` is set automatically by SLURM, and
> PyTorch correctly reports `torch.cuda.device_count() == 1`.
>
> - All code uses `.to("cuda")` or
> `.to("cuda:0")` — never a hardcoded physical ordinal — since SLURM remaps the allocated GPU
> to index 0 regardless of physical slot. All experiments are designed and validated under this
> single-GPU constraint.
>
> - KV cache + activations during API-based LLM gpt-5.4-nano generation on retrieved legal contexts consume
> several additional GB beyond model weights. Sequential model loading is the mitigation strategy.

* This is the certified baseline stack for the current repository; newer upstream stacks are intentionally deferred for now, they will be adopted only after full re-certification in this repo.
* **`BAAI/bge-m3`** is used **only in single-vector dense retrieval mode**.
* It uses **CLS pooling**, not mean pooling.
* This is defined in BAAI's published `1_Pooling/config.json`, where:
  * `pooling_mode_cls_token=true`
  * `pooling_mode_mean_tokens=false`
* The same pooling setup has also been **confirmed by smoke tests in this repository**.
* A **runtime assertion** in `src/model_loader.py` prevents accidental pooling overrides.
* The selected **pooling flags** are logged to **W&B once per run**.
* Sparse and multi-vector capabilities are out of scope.

---
## Project Feasibility Statement
**Infrastructure is complete. Corpus preprocessing is underway. The core experiment is the remaining work.**
- ✅ Environment bootstrapped, verified, reproducible (`setup.sh`, tests passing, coverage verified)
- ✅ 1,465,484 federal appellate opinions downloaded, filtered, sharded (7.6GB)
- ✅ DVC + S3 artifact versioning operational
- ✅ All `src/` modules implemented and tested
- ✅ CourtListener RAG-readiness refinement completed (Cell 2)
- ⏳ LePaRD acquisition, model training, evaluation remaining
**Prioritization:** LePaRD first → 10–20% subset fast iteration → BM25+BGE-M3+Tier A → scale + Tier B/C

## VRAM Budget and Sequential Loading Strategy
**Single GPU (23.7GB L4/A10G, SLURM-allocated).**
* Each phase loads **only the model and data it needs**.
* After a phase finishes, its resources are **unloaded before the next phase begins**.
* The default GPU execution dtype is **bfloat16**.
* At startup, `src/environment.py` enforces these checks:
  * `transformers.__version__ == "4.39.3"`
  * `torch.cuda.get_device_capability()[0] >= 8`
  * `torch.cuda.is_bf16_supported()`
* These checks ensure the environment matches the repo's certified GPU and library assumptions before execution starts.
* `TARGET_GPU_COUNT=1` is set in `.env` to match the **single-GPU allocation** provided by SLURM.
* During preflight, `setup.sh` validates that:
  * `torch.cuda.device_count() == 1`
* This ensures the runtime environment matches the expected **single-GPU execution setup**.
* Per-model fallback to fp16/fp32 remains available if a path fails smoke tests.
* For the NLI phase, `torch.backends.cuda.matmul.allow_tf32 = True` is set as a repo-level performance optimization targeting remaining float32 matmul/convolution paths on L4; in a bfloat16-heavy pipeline its impact is limited but it is retained as an opt-in inference optimization — this can trade some FP32 numerical precision for speed and is not a semantic guarantee.
* The `allow_tf32` setting is logged in **W&B** for each phase. This provides **transparency** about whether TF32 acceleration was enabled during that phase.
* As a **repo-level cleanup safeguard**, both the **DataLoader** and its **iterator** are explicitly deleted between phases.
* This deletion happens **before** calling:
  * `gc.collect()`
  * `torch.cuda.empty_cache()`
* The goal is to reduce the chance of **stale memory references** and improve **GPU memory cleanup** between pipeline phases.
* `torch.cuda.memory_stats()` is logged at each **phase boundary**.
* This records GPU memory diagnostics **before and after major pipeline stages**.
* It helps track **allocation behavior**, **memory pressure**, and possible **VRAM leaks** across phases.
* The pipeline logs **CUDA stream synchronization time** for each phase.
* **Per phase**, W&B logs:
  * **peak allocated CUDA memory**
  * **peak reserved CUDA memory**

| Phase | Model loaded| Est. VRAM| Strategy|
|-------|------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Retrieval| BGE-M3| ~2.27GB| Load (bfloat16) → encode corpus → log embedding norm distribution → save index → unload → empty_cache|
| Reranking| bge-reranker-v2-m3| ~2GB (GPU default; CPU fallback)| Load (bfloat16) → rerank top-50 (max_length=1024, batch_size=4) → log score distribution (min/mean/max/entropy) → serialize scores + ranks → return top-10 → unload → empty_cache|
| Generation| API-based LLM gpt-5.4-nano| ~14–15GB + KV cache| Load (bfloat16) → apply chat template → assert max(prompt_tokens) < 32768 → generate (do_sample=False) → log prompt token count (API-based LLM gpt-5.4-nano tokenizer) + completion token count → save → unload → empty_cache |
| NLI eval| DeBERTa-v3-large-mnli-fever-anli-ling-wanli| ~3GB + activations (overflow sliding windows; DataCollatorWithPadding pad_to_multiple_of=8; pin_memory=True) | Load (bfloat16) → classify per atomic claim → del dataloader → unload → empty_cache|
| Citation| SQLite| 0GB| CPU only (read-only; check_same_thread=False)|
| Corpus scan| Polars scan_ndjson| 0GB GPU (CPU-only)| **Mandatory** exact full-corpus scan — always uses `_full_scan_with_polars()` for all 1.46M opinions; no GPU memory contention|
Projected peak per phase is expected to remain within the 23.7GB budget; actual peaks logged in W&B.
---# Methodology Strengths
**1 — Automated Hallucination Measurement (No Human Annotation Bottleneck)**
- **Tier A:**
  - LePaRD 4M+ expert-annotated citation pairs — gold-standard retrieval ground truth
- **Tier B:**
  - `MoritzLaurer/DeBERTa-v3-large-mnli-fever-anli-ling-wanli` classifies each atomic claim independently against individual retrieved chunks. DeBERTa-v3-large has a strict 512-token position limit (`max_position_embeddings=512`; `tokenizer.model_max_length=512` enforced).
  - The NLI tokenizer uses `use_fast=False` as the repo-certified path based on local smoke tests over legal citation text. In this pinned repo environment, overflow-window generation (`return_overflowing_tokens=True, max_length=512, stride=64`) has been regression-tested for this exact model/version combination; public tokenizer docs describe overflow helpers primarily on fast tokenizers, so this behavior is treated as repo-certified rather than generally assumed.
  - Window count per chunk distribution logged to diagnose pathological long passages.
  - Window-level logits are aggregated per chunk (not per window) to preserve retrieval-level semantics and avoid double-counting.
  - The window index triggering each entailment/contradiction label is logged for post-hoc diagnosis.
  - Text is tokenized on the fly in `__getitem__` to yield CPU tensors suitable for `pin_memory=True`; `DataCollatorWithPadding(tokenizer, pad_to_multiple_of=8)` pads variable-length tensors for Tensor Core alignment on the L4/A10G.
  - `torch.backends.cuda.matmul.allow_tf32 = True` is set for the NLI phase as a repo-level performance optimization targeting remaining float32 matmul/convolution paths; in a bfloat16-heavy pipeline its impact is limited but it is retained as an opt-in inference optimization, not a semantic guarantee; state logged per phase.
  - `num_workers` is configurable (repo default 2; 4 for dedicated runs; 0 as fallback under SLURM cgroup restrictions).
  - As a repo-level cleanup safeguard, the DataLoader and iterator are explicitly deleted before `gc.collect()` + `torch.cuda.empty_cache()`.
  - Aggregation rule: if any window Entails → Entailment; else if any contradicts → Contradiction; else → Neutral.
  - Zero-claim responses logged, excluded from normalization, and reported as a separate metric.
  - Contradiction rate normalized by per-query claim count and as claims per 1K tokens.
  - NLI confidence scores are diagnostic indicators, not calibrated probabilities.
  - Neutral = evidence-gap.
  - Fully local, no API calls.
- **Tier C:**
  - SQLite connection uses `check_same_thread=False`; the evaluation path is read-only so no concurrent writes occur.
  - A unique citation hash (`opinion_id + anchor span`) is logged per Tier C lookup for deduplication analysis.
  - If NULL → Hard Citation Hallucination logged, NLI skipped.
  - If found + no local NLI support → CitationFound_NoLocalSupport logged.
  - When sliding-window fallback is used, the token offset of the citation anchor within the selected window is logged to diagnose citation drift. Windowing is citation-anchor-first:
    - (1) Hybrid uses highest-scoring reranker passage;
    - (2) keyword/regex on citation anchor;
    - (3) sliding-window fallback only if anchor extraction fails.
  - **Tier C verifies citation existence and local evidence support, not full legal reasoning correctness.**
**2 — Clean Experimental Design**
- `API-based LLM gpt-5.4-nano` held **constant** across all architectures with greedy decoding (`do_sample=False`; `temperature` omitted to suppress warnings in `transformers 4.41.2 (pinned)`).
- All prompts formatted with `tokenizer.apply_chat_template(...)` before tokenization.
- A runtime assertion `assert max(prompt_tokens) < 32768` fires loudly before generation if context exceeds API-based LLM gpt-5.4-nano's hard limit.
- Prompt token count (API-based LLM gpt-5.4-nano tokenizer) and completion token count logged per query. Observed differences are attributable to the retrieval setup.
**3 — Grounded in a Real Failure Case**
- Targets *Mata v. Avianca Airlines* (2023). Narrow, testable, motivated by documented consequence.
**4 — Production-Grade Reproducibility Already Operational**
- `src/repro.configure()` + `uv.lock` + DVC + manifest checksums + tests passing.
- `src/environment.py` asserts exact library versions and GPU configuration at startup.
- `HF_TOKEN` is required by this repo on the shared cluster for authenticated Hub access and to reduce resolver/rate-limit failures; loaded via `dotenv` in `src/environment.py`.

## Addressing TF Reviewer Comments and Instructor Notes
### Comment 1 — Feasibility of Hallucination Measurement
The evaluation is organized into **three tiers** to keep hallucination measurement feasible, automated, and scalable.
#### Tier A
Retrieval Grounding
* Uses a **capped LePaRD subset**.
* Reports standard retrieval metrics:
  * **Recall@k**
  * **MRR**
  * **NDCG@10**
#### Tier B
* Use a **1,000-query stratified sample** for evaluation.
* Run NLI locally with:
  * `MoritzLaurer/DeBERTa-v3-large-mnli-fever-anli-ling-wanli`
* This evaluation path uses **no external API calls**.
* The **NLI tokenizer** is configured with:
  * `use_fast=False` *(repo-certified setting)*
  * `tokenizer.model_max_length = 512` *(strictly enforced)*
* **Overflow window generation** has been **repo-certified** for this **exact model and version combination**. This means the behavior has been **verified within this repository setup**, rather than assumed to work generically across all environments.
* The system logs the **distribution of window counts per chunk**.
* **Window-level logits** are aggregated at the **chunk level** before final scoring.
* Text is tokenized inside `__getitem__`.
* Batch padding is handled by:
  * `DataCollatorWithPadding(pad_to_multiple_of=8)`
* Padding to a multiple of 8 helps keep tensor shapes hardware-friendly during batching. Per-claim aggregation:
| Category          | Definition                             | Aggregation                                 | Reported As                                     |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Entailment**    | Any window supports the claim          | any(entail) → Entailment                    | Faithfulness metric + confidence score          |
| **Contradiction** | No entailment, any window contradicts  | no entail + any(contradict) → Contradiction | Contradiction rate (normalized + per 1K tokens) |
| **Neutral**       | No entailment or contradiction         | else → Neutral                              | Evidence-gap — **not hallucination by default** |
* The **window index** that triggered each label is logged.
* **NLI confidence scores** are recorded for diagnostics only.
* These confidence scores are **not treated as calibrated probabilities**.
* **Zero-claim responses** are excluded from the main hallucination-rate calculation.
* The **zero-claim rate** is reported separately as its own metric.
**Tier C:**
* SQLite is configured with:
  * `check_same_thread=False`
  * **read-only access**
* A unique **citation hash** is logged for each lookup.
* If the citation resolves to **`NULL`**, it is labeled **Hard Citation Hallucination**.
* If the citation is found but has **no supporting evidence**, it is labeled **CitationFound_NoLocalSupport**.
* If fallback passage localization is required, the system logs the **citation anchor offset** for debugging.
* Passage selection follows this order:
  * **(1) Hybrid reranker**
  * **(2) Keyword / regex matching**
  * **(3) Sliding-window fallback**
- **Tier C verifies citation existence and local evidence support, not full legal reasoning correctness.**

## Self-Audit Findings and Corrections
### Revision 1 — Domain Gap
- Claims scoped to federal appellate opinions.
### Revision 2 — Hallucination Metric Definition
* **Contradiction rate** is reported in two normalized forms:
  * by **claim count**
  * per **1,000 tokens**
* **Zero-claim responses** are tracked and reported as a **separate metric**.
* **CitationFound_NoLocalSupport** is logged separately from other citation outcomes.
* The system logs the **distribution of window counts per chunk**.
* **Window-level logits** are aggregated at the **chunk level**.
* **NLI scores** are treated as **diagnostic indicators only**, not calibrated probabilities.
* **Neutral** is **not automatically counted as hallucination**.
### Revision 3 — Citation Existence vs. Citation Correctness
* **Tier C** assigns and logs a unique citation hash for every citation lookup.
* If the citation resolves to `NULL`, it is labeled **Hard Citation Hallucination**.
* If the citation is found but the cited passage does **not** provide local NLI support for the claimed proposition, it is labeled **CitationFound_NoLocalSupport**.
* If fallback passage localization is needed, the system logs the **citation anchor offset** for debugging.
* Local evidence is selected in this order:
  * **(1) Hybrid reranker**
  * **(2) Keyword / regex matching**
  * **(3) Sliding-window fallback**
### Revision 4 — Architecture Alignment
* The retrieval systems are organized along a spectrum:
  * **BM25** → lexical baseline
  * **BGE-M3** → dense retriever
  * **Hybrid** → combined retrieval pipeline
* **BM25** is indexed over the **same pre-chunked payloads** used by **BGE-M3**.
* This keeps the comparison fair by ensuring both methods operate on the same chunked inputs.
* The **1024-subword chunk budget** is a **controlled experimental design choice**.
* It is **not** a hard limitation of **BGE-M3** itself.
### Revision 5 — Scientific Claim Precision
Scoped to federal appellate opinions.
### Revision 6 — Outdated Architectures
CNN/BiLSTM replaced — see Architecture Classification.
### Revision 7 — Chunking Accuracy
* **spaCy tokens are not the same as BPE subword tokens.**
* `nlp.max_length` is set high enough to process full federal appellate opinions safely.
* Chunks are built using:
  * `AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(encoder_model)`
  * inside the chunking loop
* The chunking policy is standardized as:
  * **1024 subwords per chunk**
  * **128-subword overlap**
  * **512-subword chunks for Legal-BERT**
* This chunk budget is a **controlled experimental design choice** for retriever–reranker consistency.
* It is **not** a hard limit of **BGE-M3** itself.
* The **same pre-chunked payloads** are used for both:
  * `bm25s`
  * `BGE-M3`
* Effective prompt token count is logged per query using the **API-based LLM gpt-5.4-nano tokenizer**.
* A runtime guard enforces context length:
  * `assert max(prompt_tokens) < 32768`
* If that assertion fails, the pipeline stops loudly rather than silently overflowing context.
* Optional ablation:
  * test **64-subword overlap**
  * on a **10% subset**
### Revision 8 — LLM Generator
* The generator model is **`API-based LLM gpt-5.4-nano`**.
* It has been **smoke-tested in this repository** under **`transformers 4.41.2 (pinned)`**.
* All prompts are formatted using:
  * `tokenizer.apply_chat_template(...)`
* Generation uses **greedy decoding** with:
  * `do_sample=False`
* `temperature` is intentionally **omitted**.
* A **runtime assertion** checks prompt length before generation starts.
* This ensures the pipeline fails loudly if the prompt exceeds the allowed context size.
* The model has **no built-in moderation layer**.
### Revision 9 — VRAM / KV Cache Risk
* All experiments run on a **single SLURM-allocated GPU** with **23.7GB VRAM**.
* All models use **bfloat16** as the primary dtype.
* The environment asserts the following before execution:
  * `torch.cuda.is_bf16_supported()`
  * GPU capability **≥ 8.0**
  * pinned `transformers` version
* To stay within VRAM limits, the pipeline uses **sequential model loading**.
* Memory cleanup is enforced between phases using:
  * explicit **DataLoader deletion**
  * `torch.cuda.empty_cache()`
  * `gc.collect()`
* The pipeline logs memory and execution diagnostics at each phase, including:
  * `torch.cuda.memory_stats()`
  * CUDA stream synchronization time
  * `allow_tf32` state
* The **CrossEncoder reranker** is constrained to:
  * `max_length=1024`
  * `batch_size=4`
* The **NLI phase** uses:
  * repo-certified overflow windowing
  * `DataCollatorWithPadding(pad_to_multiple_of=8)`
  * `allow_tf32=True` (opt-in; targets remaining float32 paths; state logged)
  * `pin_memory=True`
  * configurable `num_workers`
* For SLURM-restricted environments, `num_workers=0` is available as a fallback.
* The **projected peak memory usage** is expected to remain within the **23.7GB VRAM budget**.
* **Polars** (`polars 1.39.3`) is a **mandatory hard dependency** in `src/dataset_probe.py`.
  * It is **CPU-only** and causes **zero GPU memory contention**.
  * It is imported at **module top level** — not lazily, not optionally.
  * It always performs the exact full-corpus scan via `pl.scan_ndjson` per shard.
  * It is not loaded during training, retrieval, generation, or NLI phases.
### Revision 10 — Tier C API Rate Limits
* Tier C does **not** rely on live API calls at evaluation time.
* API rate-limit risk is avoided by using a **local SQLite index** instead.
* The SQLite connection is configured with:
  * `check_same_thread=False`
  * **read-only access**
* This allows citation checks to run **locally at scale** without external API throttling.
* Result:
  * no live API dependency
  * no rate-limit bottleneck during large evaluation runs

## Research Question
* The central research question is:
  * **Which retrieval setup most improves evidence grounding and reduces contradiction and neutral-evidence failures in a legal RAG system built over U.S. federal appellate opinions?**
* The study compares **three core retrieval systems**:
  * **BM25**
  * **BGE-M3**
  * **Hybrid BM25 + BGE-M3 + CrossEncoder**
* **Legal-BERT** is included as an **optional domain-reference model**.
* The generator model is held constant as:
  * **`API-based LLM gpt-5.4-nano`**
* The generator is used under the following fixed conditions:
  * **frozen weights**
  * **greedy decoding**
  * **chat template applied**
  * **sequential loading**
---
## Scientific Methods
### Exact Hypotheses
* **H1:** The **Hybrid** system (**BM25 + BGE-M3 + CrossEncoder**) is expected to achieve **significantly higher Recall@10** than:
    * **BM25 alone**
    * **BGE-M3 alone**
  * Statistical significance will be tested using:
    * **paired bootstrap**
    * **p < 0.05**
* **H2:** Retrieval architectures with higher **Recall@10** are expected to produce significantly lower **contradiction rates** in downstream generation.
  * Contradiction rate is reported in two normalized forms:
    * by **claim count**
    * per **1,000 tokens**
  * **Zero-claim responses are excluded** from this calculation.
  * The purpose of this hypothesis is to test whether better retrieval reduces **active hallucination**.
  * This also helps separate true contradiction errors from simple **retrieval-coverage gaps**.
* **H3:** The **Hybrid** retrieval system is expected to achieve **higher Recall@10** than either of the single-method baselines used alone:
    * **BGE-M3**
    * **BM25**
### Task Definition
* **Retrieval:** Minimize rank(p* | q, C) over CourtListener federal appellate corpus C. The system receives a legal question **`q`**, searches the corpus **`C`** of federal appellate opinions, and tries to place the **correct supporting passage `p*`** as high as possible in the results list. `rank(p* | q, C)` is the retrieval position of the gold legal passage `p*` for query `q` within corpus `C`, and minimizing it means pushing the correct evidence as close to the top of the retrieved results as possible.
* **Generation input** consists of:
  * the query `q`
  * the **top-10 retrieved chunks**
  * each chunk capped at **1024 subwords**
"q + top-10 chunks" means the user's query combined with the 10 highest-ranked retrieved evidence chunks, which together form the grounded input sent to the generator model.
  * The full prompt is formatted using:
    * `tokenizer.apply_chat_template(...)`
  * The generator model is:
    * `API-based LLM gpt-5.4-nano`
  * The generator is kept **frozen** during evaluation.
  * Decoding uses:
    * `do_sample=False`
  * The model is loaded using a **sequential loading strategy**.
  * Output response is:
    * `R`
  * Before generation starts, a **runtime assertion** checks prompt length.
  * The **effective prompt token count** is logged for each query using the **API-based LLM gpt-5.4-nano tokenizer**.
  * Begin with **Tier A** on a **10–20% subset** of the data.
  * Use this smaller run to **validate the pipeline and metrics first**.
  * Add **Tier B** and **Tier C** only after Tier A has been successfully validated.
### Data Split Strategy (Capped)

|-----------------|---------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Training pairs  | 500K–1M       | Contrastive convergence in hours on L4/A10G     |

| Hybrid w/o reranker vs full | Cross-encoder reranker contribution |
| Legal-BERT vs BGE-M3 | Domain adaptation vs scale |

---
## Architecture Classification
| ID | Architecture | Type | Role |
|----|-------------|------|------|
| (a) | BM25 | Non-neural baseline | Reference floor |
| (b) | BGE-M3 (BAAI/bge-m3, CLS pooling per BAAI config) | Modern dense retriever — CLS pooling per published BAAI config | Primary dense baseline — 1024-subword chunks (design choice) |
| (c) | Hybrid: BM25+BGE-M3+bge-reranker-v2-m3 | Transformer + lexical + CrossEncoder reranker | **Expected strongest** |
| (d) | Legal-BERT Bi-Encoder | Domain-specific Transformer | Optional domain-reference model |
* **Sparse retrieval** uses **`bm25s`**, `bm25s` is indexed over the **same pre-chunked payloads** embedded by **BGE-M3**. "pre-chunked payloads" means the retrieval-ready text chunks created ahead of time from legal opinions and reused identically by BM25 and BGE-M3 so the architecture comparison stays fair and reproducible.**
* **Dense retrieval** uses the repo-certified stack:
  * `sentence-transformers 3.1.1`
  * `transformers 4.41.2 (pinned)`
* It uses **CLS pooling**, following BAAI's published:
  * `1_Pooling/config.json`
* A **runtime assertion** in `model_loader.py` prevents accidental pooling override.
* The active **pooling flags** are logged to **Weights & Biases (W&B)** once per run.
* The chunking policy is standardized as follows:
  * **1024 subwords per chunk**
  * **128-subword overlap**
  * **512 subwords per chunk for Legal-BERT**
* This is a **controlled experimental design choice**.
* It is intended to keep chunking **consistent across the pipeline**.
* **Reranker model:** `BAAI/bge-reranker-v2-m3`
  * is being loaded and run using the **CrossEncoder class provided by the `sentence-transformers` library**.
  * is smoke-tested in this repository
  * uses **bfloat16** as the primary dtype
  * runs on **GPU by default**
  * supports **CPU fallback** if GPU execution is unavailable
  * is configured with:
    * `max_length=1024`
    * `batch_size=4`
  * logs reranker **score distributions**, including:
    * minimum
    * mean
    * maximum
    * entropy
  * **Ranks are serialized** for later analysis
  * Reranking flow **top-50 → top-10**: the system first retrieves 50 likely relevant legal chunks, then reranks those candidates and keeps the 10 strongest chunks as final evidence for downstream answer generation.
* **FAISS Flat** is used for:
  * capped experiments
  * validation runs
* **FAISS IVF** is reserved for:
  * full-corpus final runs
* Before IVF search is used:
  * `index.train()` is run on an approximately **100K-vector subset**
  * `assert index.is_trained` verifies that training completed successfully
* To justify the chosen IVF settings:
  * **recall@k vs. nprobe** is logged on the validation set
* The following FAISS search parameters are logged to **W&B** for each run:
  * `nprobe`
  * `nlist`
* CPU thread settings are controlled in `setup.sh` through:
  * `OMP_NUM_THREADS`
  * `MKL_NUM_THREADS`
* **FAISS runs on CPU** in this setup.
* The pinned package version is **`faiss-cpu 1.13.2`**.

## DL System Stack
### Stage 1 — Raw Data Acquisition
* **CourtListener federal appellate subset (✅)**
  * Contains **1,465,484 opinions**
  * Stored as **23-field JSONL** records
* **Tier C citation support**
  * Uses a local **SQLite citation index**
  * Configured with `check_same_thread=False`
  * Evaluation path is **read-only**
  * A **citation hash** is logged for every lookup
* **Iteration strategy**
  * **Fast iteration:** ~150K opinions (**10% subset**)
  * **Final runs:** full **1.46M-opinion** corpus
* **LePaRD** is **Priority 1**.
* The full dataset contains **~4 million pairs**.
* Training will be **capped at 500K–1M pairs** for feasibility.
* The dataset source is:
  * **Hugging Face**
  * **GitHub**
* `src/dataset_loader.py` is already **ready** for LePaRD ingestion.
* This repo requires **`HF_TOKEN`** on the shared cluster.
* `HF_TOKEN` is used for:
  * authenticated Hugging Face access
  * reducing resolver failures
  * reducing rate-limit failures
* The token is loaded via **`dotenv`** in:
  * `src/environment.py`
* It is then passed to every:
  * `from_pretrained()` call
* All datasets and artifacts are tracked with **DVC**.
* The DVC remote storage is **S3**.
* The configured S3 bucket is:
  * `cs1090b-hallucinationlegalragchatbots`
* The bucket region is:
  * `us-east-2`
### Stage 2 — Raw Artifact Registration
* An **immutable manifest** is generated for the dataset and pipeline state.
* The manifest records:
  * **159 shard checksums**
  * **1,465,484 total rows**
  * the full **filter-chain provenance**
  * the **`uv.lock` SHA256** value
* **Contract tests** validate the manifest on **every pipeline run**.
* An **SBOM** is also generated, covering **357 software components**.
### Stage 3 — Preprocessing + Tokenizer-Aware Chunking
* Data is processed through a **streaming CSV pipeline**.
* Preprocessing includes:
  * **HTML stripping**
  * **encoding cleanup**
  * **Westlaw boilerplate removal**
* A **stripped-down spaCy pipeline** is used with:
  * `exclude=["ner", "parser", "lemmatizer"]`
* `nlp.max_length` is set high enough to safely handle **full federal appellate opinions**.
* Chunks are built using:
  * `AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(encoder_model)`
  * inside the **chunking loop**
* The chunking policy is standardized as:
  * **1024 subwords per chunk**
  * **128-subword overlap**
  * **512-subword chunks for Legal-BERT**
* This chunk budget is a **controlled experimental design choice** for **retriever–reranker consistency**.
* It is **not** a hard limitation of **BGE-M3**.
* Pre-chunked string payloads are:
  * **saved once**
  * **reused by both BGE-M3 and `bm25s`**
* Effective prompt token count is logged per query using the **API-based LLM gpt-5.4-nano tokenizer**.
* A runtime guard enforces prompt length:
  * `assert max(prompt_tokens) < 32768`
* If that assertion fails, the pipeline stops loudly instead of silently exceeding context limits.
* The pipeline creates **citation-aware data splits**.
* Metadata stored for each chunk includes:
  * `court_id`
  * `year`
  * `is_precedential`
  * `opinion_id`
  * `chunk_index`
* A **SQLite citation index** is built from:
  * `data/raw/cl_federal_appellate_bulk`
  * via `src/extract.py`
* **Dataset readiness probing** (`src/dataset_probe.py` v2.5.11) runs before chunking:
  * **Polars is a mandatory hard dependency** — `import polars as pl` at module top level.
  * `run_probe()` **always** calls `_full_scan_with_polars()`.
  * All probe behaviour is governed by **`ProbeConfig`** — the frozen dataclass that defines how the probe evaluates the CourtListener corpus for downstream legal RAG research.
  * **Contract tests** in `tests/test_dataset_probe.py` ensure the probe's formal structure and behavior remain intact — see Contract Test Suite below.
  * `run_probe()` returns a **typed `ProbeReport(BaseModel)`**.

#### Contract Test Suite — `tests/test_dataset_probe.py`

##### Purpose
* `tests/test_dataset_probe.py` is the **single authoritative contract test file** for `src/dataset_probe.py`.
* Its role is to ensure that the dataset probe, its constants, its `ProbeConfig`, its gates, and its typed outputs continue to satisfy the **formal structure and behavior that downstream legal RAG research infrastructure relies on**.
* The test file is organized into **over 60 named test classes** covering distinct contractual obligations. All tests run under the `pytest` + `hypothesis` framework and are enforced on every push via CI.
* **303 tests pass** as of the current version (confirmed by `uv run pytest tests/test_dataset_probe.py -m "unit or contract" -q`).

##### Contract test categories and what they protect

**Constants contracts (`TestModuleLevelConstants`, `TestProbeVersion`)**
* Assert that `PROVISIONAL_MIN_TEXT_LENGTH == 1500`, `CHUNK_SIZE_SUBWORDS == 1024`, `CHUNK_OVERLAP_SUBWORDS == 128`, `ENCODER_MODEL == "BAAI/bge-m3"`, `SPACY_MODEL == "en_core_web_sm"`, `MIN_SENTENCE_COUNT == 20` — all as integer or string literals with no type annotations.
* Assert that the source file contains these literal assignments (e.g., `"CHUNK_SIZE_SUBWORDS = 1024" in source`) — preventing silent drift where a constant changes value without the test catching it.
* Assert `PROBE_VERSION` is a string of length ≥ 3 — the instrument version recorded in every `ProbeReport`.

**`ProbeConfig` contracts (`TestProbeConfig`, `TestA11ChunkCountFormula`)**
* Assert `ProbeConfig()` is **frozen** — mutating a field raises `AttributeError` or `TypeError`.
* Assert `ProbeConfig().min_text_length == PROVISIONAL_MIN_TEXT_LENGTH` — the critical invariant that `ProbeConfig` defaults must equal module constants.
* Assert `_probe_config_to_dict(ProbeConfig())` is JSON-serializable — guarantees the config snapshot in `provenance["probe_config"]` can always be written to disk and W&B.
* Assert `ProbeConfig()` has `a11_generative_model` field — the secondary API-based LLM gpt-5.4-nano tokenizer check.
* Assert all new `ProbeConfig` fields appear in `report["provenance"]["probe_config"]` — confirms the config snapshot is complete in every `ProbeReport`.
* Assert the A11 chunk count formula (`stride = chunk_size - overlap; n_chunks = max(1, ceil((total - overlap) / stride))`) matches `CHUNK_SIZE_SUBWORDS=1024` and `CHUNK_OVERLAP_SUBWORDS=128` — regression test against chunking formula drift.

**`GateResult` contracts (`TestGateResultModel`)**
* Assert `GateResult` is importable and is a Pydantic `BaseModel`.
* Assert `GateResult` has required fields `gate` and `severity`.
* Assert `GateResult.model_dump()` is JSON-serializable.
* Assert `GateResult` is **frozen** — mutation raises `FrozenInstanceError`.

**`ProbeReport` contracts (`TestProbeReportModel`)**
* Assert `ProbeReport` is importable and is a Pydantic `BaseModel`.
* Assert `run_probe()` returns a `ProbeReport` instance — not a raw dict.
* Assert `report["gates"]` works via `__getitem__` (backward-compatible dict-style access).
* Assert `"gates" in report` works via `__contains__`.
* Assert `report.gates` attribute access works natively.
* Assert `report.summary` has `all_passed` key.
* Assert `json.dumps(report.model_dump())` succeeds — full JSON serializability.

**`GATE_REGISTRY` contracts (`TestGateRegistry`)**
* Assert registry is non-empty and iterable.
* Assert all 7 core gates are present: A7, A8, A9, A11, A12, A13, B6.
* Assert every entry has `"name"`, `"fn"` (callable), and `"severity"` keys.
* Assert A7, A8, A11, A12, A13 are `"blocking"`; A9 and B6 are `"advisory"`.
* Assert every non-tokenizer, non-spaCy gate function is callable with `(records, cfg)` and returns a dict with a `"gate"` key — live execution contract.

**`STAGE3_REQUIRED_FIELDS` contracts (`TestStage3RequiredFields`)**
* Assert `STAGE3_REQUIRED_FIELDS` is a `frozenset` and is exported.
* Assert it is a subset of `DOCUMENTED_FIELDS`.
* Assert it contains key Stage 3 fields: `id`, `court_id`, `text`, `text_length`, `text_source`, `date_filed`, `text_hash`.
* Assert `validate_schema()` reports `stage3_pass` and `stage3_missing_counts` for records missing Stage 3 fields.
* Assert `stage3_pass=True` appears in `report["provenance"]` when all 17 fields are present.

**Stratified sampling contracts (`TestStratifiedSampling`)**
* Assert `run_probe()` with `ProbeConfig(stratify_by="court_id")` does not crash.
* Assert `report["subset_n"] <= subset` after stratified subsampling.

**W&B isolation contracts (`TestLogReportToWandbIsolation`, `TestRunProbeNoLogToWandbParam`, `TestRunProbeNoInlineWandb`, `TestLogReportToWandbSingleCall`)**
* Assert `run_probe()` signature does not include a `log_to_wandb` parameter — telemetry must stay in `main()`.
* Assert `_log_report_to_wandb` is not called anywhere inside `run_probe()` — verified by inspecting the source AST.
* Assert `wandb.log` is called **exactly once** per `_log_report_to_wandb` invocation — the single consolidated log call contract.

**Lazy import contracts (`TestLazyImportBehavior`, `TestImportStyle`)**
* Assert `spacy` is NOT imported at module top level (lazy import pattern).
* Assert `transformers.AutoTokenizer` is NOT imported at module top level.
* Assert the source contains `import polars as pl` at module level (mandatory hard import).

**Full-scan and shard audit contracts (`TestFullScanCLI`, `TestShardAuditTotalRecordsDecoded`, `TestShardAuditOnePassStreaming`)**
* Assert `--full-scan` CLI flag triggers Polars path and reports `full_scan=True` in provenance.
* Assert `shard_audit["total_records_decoded"]` reflects the actual number of records loaded.
* Assert the one-pass streaming audit correctly counts parse errors and blank lines.

**Schema helper contracts (`TestValidateSchemaHelpers`, `TestValidateSchemaDocumentedFields`, `TestValidateSchemaTextLengthConsistency`)**
* Assert each composable helper (`_check_presence`, `_check_types_and_ranges`, `_check_vocabulary`, `_check_consistency`, `_check_documented_coverage`) returns dicts with expected keys.
* Assert `validate_schema()` `pass=True` when all required fields present and valid.
* Assert consistency check uses OR logic — absolute tolerance OR relative tolerance.

**Property-based tests (`TestPercentileProperty`, `TestGateA8Property`)**
* Use `hypothesis` to assert `_percentile()` satisfies monotonicity and boundary conditions over arbitrary sorted lists.
* Use `hypothesis` to assert A8 gate `pass` field is always a boolean regardless of input distribution.

#### `ProbeConfig` — Defines How the Probe Evaluates the Corpus for Downstream Legal RAG

##### What `ProbeConfig` is
* `ProbeConfig` is a **frozen dataclass** (`@dataclasses.dataclass(frozen=True)`) — the single source of truth for how `src/dataset_probe.py` evaluates the CourtListener corpus.
* Every gate threshold, subsample size, model name, quality signal pattern, and stratification strategy are controlled by `ProbeConfig` fields — no gate uses hardcoded values.
* **Frozen** means: once constructed, values cannot change. Every probe run is a reproducible measurement.
* `_probe_config_to_dict(cfg)` serializes to a JSON-safe dict (frozensets → sorted lists, tuples → lists, None preserved) — recorded in `provenance["probe_config"]` and passed to `wandb.init(config=...)`.

##### The six evaluation dimensions `ProbeConfig` controls

| Dimension | Key fields | What it evaluates |
|-----------|-----------|-------------------|
| Text viability | `min_text_length=1500`, `chunk_size_subwords=1024`, `chunk_overlap_subwords=128` | Minimum chars for meaningful chunking; chunk window for A11 |
| Source format | `a7_known_formats_pass_pct=80.0`, `a7_known_formats={"plain_text","html_with_citations"}` | % of records from formats confirmed to survive normalization |
| Citation anchor | `a12_min_pct_with_anchor=60.0`, `a9_zero_citation_pass_pct=20.0` | SQLite Tier C viability |
| Chunk count | `a11_min_median_chunks=2.0`, `encoder_model="BAAI/bge-m3"`, `a11_generative_model` | Multi-chunk splitting + API-based LLM gpt-5.4-nano context limit advisory |
| Sentence density | `min_sentence_count=20`, `a13_max_below_threshold_pct=15.0`, `spacy_model` | NLI window coverage floor |
| Entropy / quality | `b6_entropy_spot_check_tolerance=1.0`, `quality_signals_html_pattern`, `quality_signals_boilerplate_phrases` | Tokenization drift + boilerplate survival |

Plus: schema consistency (`text_length_consistency_tolerance=200`, `text_length_relative_tolerance=0.05`) and stratified sampling (`stratify_by: str | None = None`).

##### `ProbeConfig` contracts enforced by test suite
* `ProbeConfig()` is frozen — mutation raises exception (`TestProbeConfig.test_is_frozen`)
* `ProbeConfig().min_text_length == PROVISIONAL_MIN_TEXT_LENGTH` — defaults equal module constants (`TestProbeConfig.test_default_min_text_length`)
* `_probe_config_to_dict(ProbeConfig())` is JSON-serializable (`TestProbeConfig.test_is_json_serializable`)
* All new fields appear in `report["provenance"]["probe_config"]` (`TestProbeConfig.test_all_new_fields_in_provenance`)

#### Module-Level Constants — Controlled Measurement Infrastructure
| Constant | Value | Module constant → `ProbeConfig` field invariant |
|----------|-------|------------------------------------------------|
| `PROBE_VERSION` | `"2.5.11"` | N/A — instrument version |
| `PROVISIONAL_MIN_TEXT_LENGTH` | `1500` | = `ProbeConfig().min_text_length` |
| `CHUNK_SIZE_SUBWORDS` | `1024` | = `ProbeConfig().chunk_size_subwords` |
| `CHUNK_OVERLAP_SUBWORDS` | `128` | = `ProbeConfig().chunk_overlap_subwords` |
| `ENCODER_MODEL` | `"BAAI/bge-m3"` | = `ProbeConfig().encoder_model` |
| `SPACY_MODEL` | `"en_core_web_sm"` | = `ProbeConfig().spacy_model` |
| `MIN_SENTENCE_COUNT` | `20` | = `ProbeConfig().min_sentence_count` |
| `DOCUMENTED_FIELDS` | 23-field frozenset | Full schema advisory coverage |
| `KNOWN_TEXT_SOURCES` | 8-value frozenset | A7 vocabulary check |
| `MIN_REQUIRED_FIELDS` | 11-field frozenset | Blocking CI gate minimum |
| `STAGE3_REQUIRED_FIELDS` | 17-field frozenset | Stage 3 readiness gate |
| `GATE_REGISTRY` | 7-entry ordered list | Self-describing gate manifest |

#### `stratify_by` — Minority-Group-Preserving Stratified Subsampling
* `ProbeConfig.stratify_by: str | None = None` — tells the probe which record attribute to use for proportional post-scan stratified subsampling.
* Called **after** `_full_scan_with_polars()` — guarantees every stratum gets **at least 1 record**.
* `shard_audit["stratified_by"]` records provenance. Uses Python stdlib `random.Random`.

#### Mandatory Exact Full-Corpus Scan
* `import polars as pl` at module top level — no fallback.
* `run_probe()` defaults `full_scan=True` — always scans all 1,465,484 opinions via `pl.scan_ndjson()` per shard.
* `provenance["full_scan"]=True` and `provenance["polars_version"]` always recorded.

#### Stage 3 Readiness Gate — `STAGE3_REQUIRED_FIELDS` (17 fields)
| Field | Stage 3 Role |
|-------|-------------|
| `id` | Primary key for chunk metadata and SQLite citation index |
| `court_id` | Circuit-stratified evaluation; chunk metadata |
| `court_name` | Human-readable circuit label for W&B logging |
| `text` | Source text for tokenizer-aware chunking |
| `text_length` | Pre-filter: `< 1500` chars excluded before chunking |
| `text_source` | Determines preprocessing path in `row_normalizer.py` |
| `citation_count` | Fast-iteration corpus filter |
| `citation_density` | Quality signal; logged in W&B |
| `is_precedential` | Chunk metadata; weights retrieval results |
| `text_entropy` | B6 gate input; p10 used as low-entropy filter |
| `token_count` | A11 gate cross-validation input |
| `paragraph_count` | A13 sentence density proxy |
| `date_filed` | Chunk metadata; temporal filtering |
| `opinion_type` | Chunk metadata; majority/concurrence/dissent |
| `precedential_status` | Vocabulary-checked; gates chunking of non-binding opinions |
| `text_hash` | Deduplication key for FAISS and BM25 index |
| `source` | Provenance field for DVC artifact lineage |

#### Typed Contracts
* `GateResult(BaseModel)`: `extra=allow, frozen=True` — immutable; fields `gate: str`, `severity: str`.
* `ProbeReport(BaseModel)`: `extra=allow, frozen=False` — `__getitem__`/`__contains__` backward compat; `model_dump()` carries full `ProbeConfig` snapshot.
* **pydantic>=2.12.5** — pyproject.toml line 37; 49 locked entries in uv.lock.

#### Lazy Loading
| Dependency | Import strategy | Triggered by |
|------------|----------------|-------------|
| `polars` | **Hard import at module top** | Always |
| `spacy` | Lazy — `_load_spacy_nlp()` | Gate A13 only |
| `transformers.AutoTokenizer` | Lazy | Gate A11 only |
| `wandb` | Optional `try/except ImportError` | `--log-to-wandb` in `main()` only |

#### W&B Telemetry Contract
* `_log_report_to_wandb()` is **exclusively a `main()` concern** — enforced by `TestLogReportToWandbIsolation`.
* `wandb.log` called **exactly once** per invocation — enforced by `TestLogReportToWandbSingleCall`.
* `ProbeConfig` snapshot passed to `wandb.init(config=...)`.

#### W&B Metrics Logged Per Phase
| Namespace | Metric | Source |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| `probe/` | `all_passed`, `passed_count`, `failed_blocking_count`, `subset_n`, `parse_errors` | `_log_report_to_wandb` |

| `gate/A13/` | `median_sentences`, `below_threshold_pct`, `records_after_a8_filter` | A13 gate result |
| `gate/B6/` | `p5`, `p10`, `p25`, `p75`, `mean`, `median`, `zero_entropy_count` | B6 gate result |

#### W&B CLI Usage
```bash
uv run python -m src.dataset_probe \
    --data-dir data/raw/cl_federal_appellate_bulk \
    --output logs/dataset_probe_report.json \
    --log-to-wandb \
    --wandb-entity phl690-harvard-extension-schol \
    --wandb-project cs1090b \
    --wandb-name dataset_probe_v2.5.11_full
```

When integrated, the full logger tracks:
* **Per-phase GPU hours**
* **Peak CUDA memory**
* **Allocator diagnostics**
* **CUDA stream synchronization times**
* **`allow_tf32` state** for each phase
* **BGE-M3 pooling flags**
* **Embedding norm distributions**
* **Reranker score distributions**, including:
  * minimum
  * mean
  * maximum
  * entropy
* **FAISS retrieval diagnostics**, including:
  * Recall@k vs `nprobe`
  * `nprobe`
  * `nlist`
* **NLI window count distributions**
* **NLI confidence distributions**
* **Window indices per label**
* **Per-query claim counts**
* **Claims per 1,000 tokens**
* **Zero-claim rate**
* **Hard Citation Hallucination counts**
* **CitationFound_NoLocalSupport counts**
* **Citation hashes**
* **Citation anchor token offsets**
* **Prompt token counts** using the API-based LLM gpt-5.4-nano tokenizer
* **Completion token counts**
* **Gradient norms**
* **Dataset probe gate results** (A7–A13, B6) including parse error counts and full_scan provenance
### Stage 4 — Index Generation *(not started)*
* **BM25 (`bm25s`)** is indexed over the **pre-chunked payloads from Stage 3**, not over raw text.
* The **FAISS dense index** uses two modes:
  * **Flat index** for capped / validation runs
    * no index training required
  * **IVF index** for full-corpus final runs
    * `index.train()` runs on a random subset of about **100K vectors**
    * `assert index.is_trained` is checked before search
* To justify IVF settings, the pipeline logs:
  * **recall@k vs. nprobe** on the validation set
  * **nprobe** and **nlist** per run in **W&B**
* Threading controls are set in `setup.sh` with:
  * `OMP_NUM_THREADS`
  * `MKL_NUM_THREADS`
* **`BAAI/bge-reranker-v2-m3`** is used through the **`sentence-transformers` CrossEncoder** path.
* This reranker path has been **smoke-tested in the repository**.
* Reranker execution settings:
  * primary dtype: **bfloat16**
  * **GPU by default**
  * **CPU fallback available**
  * `max_length=1024`
  * `batch_size=4`
* The reranker logs score distribution statistics, including:
  * **minimum**
  * **mean**
  * **maximum**
  * **entropy**
* Reranker outputs are persisted by:
  * serializing **scores**
  * serializing **ranks**
* The reranker returns the **top 10** results after reranking.
* A **SQLite citation index** is also maintained for citation-related lookup tasks.
### Stage 5 — Model Training *(not started)*
* Training is **capped at 500K–1M pairs**.
* **Early stopping** is used to avoid unnecessary training once performance stops improving.
* **Gradient accumulation** is used to support effective larger-batch training under GPU memory constraints.
* **GPU hours** are logged to **Weights & Biases (W&B)**.
### Stage 6 — Evaluation *(not started)*
* All models use **bfloat16** as the primary dtype.
* `environment.py` asserts the following at startup:
  * `transformers.__version__ == "4.39.3"`
  * `torch.cuda.get_device_capability()[0] >= 8`
  * `torch.cuda.is_bf16_supported()`
* `TARGET_GPU_COUNT=1` is validated against:
  * `torch.cuda.device_count()`
* Models are loaded **sequentially** according to the VRAM budget plan.
* At every phase boundary, the pipeline performs cleanup and logging:
  * `torch.cuda.memory_stats()`
  * CUDA stream synchronization time
  * `allow_tf32` state
  * explicit DataLoader deletion
  * `torch.cuda.empty_cache()`
  * `gc.collect()`
* **BGE-M3**
  * pooling flags are logged to **W&B**
  * embedding norm distribution is logged
* **Reranker**
  * score distributions are logged, including:
    * minimum
    * mean
    * maximum
    * entropy
* **API-based LLM gpt-5.4-nano**
  * prompt formatting is enforced with:
    * `tokenizer.apply_chat_template(...)`
  * prompt length is guarded by:
    * `assert max(prompt_tokens) < 32768`
  * generation uses:
    * `do_sample=False`
  * per-query logging includes:
    * prompt token count
    * completion token count
* **`MoritzLaurer/DeBERTa-v3-large-mnli-fever-anli-ling-wanli`**
  * uses `use_fast=False` as the repo-certified path
  * enforces:
    * `tokenizer.model_max_length=512`
  * overflow windowing is repo-certified for this exact model/version
  * logs:
    * window count per chunk distribution
    * window index for each assigned label
  * aggregates:
    * window-level logits at the **chunk level**
  * uses:
    * `DataCollatorWithPadding(tokenizer, pad_to_multiple_of=8)`
    * `allow_tf32=True` (opt-in; targets remaining float32 matmul/convolution paths; limited impact in bfloat16-heavy pipeline; state logged)
    * `pin_memory=True`
    * configurable `num_workers`
* **SQLite citation layer**
  * logs a citation hash for every lookup
  * `NULL` is labeled:
    * **Hard Citation Hallucination**
  * found citation but no support is labeled:
    * **CitationFound_NoLocalSupport**
  * citation anchor offset is logged when fallback logic is used
* Reported metrics include:
  * contradiction rate
    * normalized by claim count
    * reported per 1K tokens
  * zero-claim rate
  * Hard Citation Hallucination rate
  * CitationFound_NoLocalSupport rate
* The projected peak VRAM usage remains within the **23.7GB** budget.
### Stage 7 — Experiment Tracking *(not started)*
* `src/wandb_logger.py` is **implemented and ready**.
* **W&B run initialization is still pending** — integration fires once LePaRD training begins.
* `wandb` is declared as **`wandb>=0.16`** in `pyproject.toml` and fully pinned in `uv.lock` (13 locked entries).
* In `src/dataset_probe.py`, `wandb` is imported inside a **`try/except ImportError`** block — degrades gracefully with `wandb = None` if unavailable.
* In `src/wandb_logger.py`, all W&B calls use **lazy imports inside each function**.

## Ethical Considerations
* All datasets used in the project are **publicly available**.
* **CourtListener** data is used under **CC BY-ND 4.0**.
* **`API-based LLM gpt-5.4-nano`** does **not** include built-in moderation mechanisms, according to its model card.
* Model outputs are used **strictly for retrieval research** under **academic supervision**.
* Any **PII handling** follows the **redaction practices of the original data provider**.
* The project uses **no human annotation** for hallucination measurement.

**Performance:** 159 shards × ~422 MB audited in 30s using 48 CPU cores (5.17 shards/s).

### Interpretation of W&B run results

**`data/gate_verdict: CLEAN`** — All 1,465,484 lines across 159 shards passed the data contract. Zero non-finite floats, zero string sentinels, zero malformed JSON, zero encoding errors. The dataset is unconditionally safe to ingest into Stage 3 retrieval, chunking, citation, and NLI pipelines.

**`data/clean_pct: 100`** — The pre-training corpus has been semantically repaired in a prior run (bare NaN tokens in `case_name` were replaced with `null`). This confirms the repair was both complete and idempotent — a second pass changes zero lines.

**`config/workers: 48`** — The audit used all available CPU cores on the GPU node. At 5.17 shards/s, the full corpus audit completes in ~30 seconds, making it practical to run as a mandatory pre-training gate before every GPU allocation.

**`config/strict_encoding: False`** — Lenient encoding mode was used (`errors="replace"`). Zero decode errors were recorded, confirming no byte-level corruption exists in the corpus. A `--strict-encoding` pass can be added for additional byte-integrity assurance.

**4 W&B artifacts synced** — The `DatasetHealth` JSON, git SHA of the audit script, resolved advisory policy, and per-field contamination Table are permanently stored as a W&B artifact. Any future researcher can download the exact data-health snapshot to verify the corpus state at the moment of ingestion.

**Zero `nan_fields` entries** — No schema fields carry contamination. This is the strongest possible signal: even advisory fields (`case_name`, `raw_text`, `cleaning_flags`) are clean, ruling out any silent gradient poisoning from non-finite embeddings in downstream attention layers.

**Research implication** — If a model trained on this corpus later exhibits loss spikes or elevated perplexity, the W&B telemetry run `jnqc9vo4` provides a provable baseline: the data was 100% clean at ingestion. The anomaly must originate downstream (model architecture, optimizer, tokenizer, or sampling), not in the pre-training corpus.

### Telemetry capabilities

| Feature | Implementation |
|---------|---------------|
| Typed counters | `nonfinite_lines`, `string_sentinel_lines`, `decode_error_lines` |
| Field attribution | `nan_fields: {"field": count}` |
| Shard provenance | `contaminated_shards: [...]` |
| Gate verdict | `CLEAN / REPAIRABLE / HARD_FAILURE / PARSE_FAILURE` |
| W&B scalars | `data/clean_pct`, `data/gate_verdict`, `data/nan_lines` |
| W&B Table | Per-field contamination histogram (`--telemetry-level detailed`) |
| W&B Artifact | `DatasetHealth` JSON + git_sha (4 artifacts synced) |
| Provenance | `git_sha`, `python_version`, `polars_version` per run |
| Config snapshot | `advisory_fields`, `strict_encoding`, `workers` |
| CI gating | `--fail-under FLOAT` exits non-zero if `clean_pct < threshold` |
| Job type | `wandb.init(job_type="data-quality-gate")` |
| Severity hierarchy | Decode errors dominate advisory contamination in verdict |
| Offline safe | `WANDB_MODE=offline` for HPC/SLURM environments |
| Lazy import | Pipeline runs without `wandb` installed |

### Telemetry flow
```
audit_shard() × 159 shards (48 workers, 5.17 shards/s)
    → ShardHealth (typed counters per shard)
    → sum(results, start=DatasetHealth.zero())
    → gate_verdict() → CLEAN / REPAIRABLE / HARD_FAILURE / PARSE_FAILURE
    → log_health_to_wandb() → W&B scalars + Table + Artifact (live sync)
    → --fail-under gate → sys.exit(1) if clean_pct < threshold
```

### Gate Results

| Gate | Description | Severity | Result | RAG Interpretation |
|------|-------------|----------|--------|--------------------|
| `schema` | Field presence, types, ranges, `text_length` consistency | Blocking | ✅ PASSED | All 1,465,484 records carry every required field with correct types and internally consistent metadata. No silent coercion risk in downstream vector indexing. |
| `A7` | Text source breakdown (`plain_text`, `html_with_citations`, etc.) | Blocking | ✅ PASSED | Source distribution is dominated by known, parser-compatible formats. No unexpected format drift that would corrupt chunk boundaries or citation extraction. |
| `A8` | Text length distribution (p5–p95, % below 1,500-char threshold) | Blocking | ✅ PASSED | Fewer than 25% of opinions fall below the provisional minimum length. Long-tail length distribution is healthy — sufficient text density for meaningful embedding. |
| `A9` | Citation count distribution (zero-citation rate) | Advisory | ✅ PASSED | Fewer than 20% of opinions carry zero citations. High citation density across the corpus is the primary signal that grounded retrieval is possible — directly reducing hallucination risk. |
| `A12` | Citation anchor survival (regex anchor vs. stored `citation_count`) | Blocking | ✅ PASSED | Legal citation patterns survive the full ingestion pipeline. Retrieval queries anchored to case citations (`123 F.3d 456`) will find their source documents — critical for citation-grounded RAG. |
| `B6` | Text entropy distribution (Shannon entropy on whitespace tokens) | Advisory | ✅ PASSED | Entropy is consistent with rich, information-dense legal prose. Low-entropy outliers (boilerplate, repeated headers) are within acceptable bounds and will not dominate embedding space. |
| `A11` | Tokenizer-aware chunk count (BAAI/bge-m3, 1024-subword chunks, 128 overlap) | Blocking | ✅ PASSED | Median chunk count per document confirms the corpus will produce multi-chunk embeddings. **Warning observed:** at least one opinion tokenises to 19,544 subwords — 2.4× the 8,192-token context window. Stage 3 must enforce citation-aware recursive chunking to prevent silent truncation of holdings at document tail. |
| `A13` | Sentence density (spaCy `en_core_web_sm` sentenciser, min 20 sentences) | Blocking | ✅ PASSED | The majority of opinions contain sufficient sentence-level structure for sentence-window retrieval and reranking strategies. Sparse-sentence outliers are within tolerance and will not degrade recall. |

**FAILED_BLOCKING:** none
**FAILED_ADVISORY:** none
**SKIPPED:** none

### Pre-Probe Data Repairs

Two surgical repair passes were applied before this run to eliminate the only two population-scale data quality issues found during audit:

1. **NaN repair** (`scripts/audit_jsonl_nan.py --fix`): 25,793 bare `NaN` tokens in the `case_name` field across 135/159 shards were replaced with `null`. Root cause: upstream `extract.py` used Python's `json.dumps` default `allow_nan=True`, producing tokens illegal under strict JSON parsers (Polars tape parser). All affected records are fully recoverable — `case_name` is advisory metadata, not required for chunking or retrieval.

2. **text_length repair** (`scripts/repair_text_length.py`): 3 records (IDs: 4659133, 3034079, 2810519) had stale `text_length` metadata where stored values exceeded actual `len(text)` by 216–276 characters — consistent with a post-ingestion whitespace normalisation pass that ran after length was first recorded. Repaired by recomputing `text_length = len(text)` in-place with `.bak` backup.

### Verdict

> **The full 1,465,484-record CourtListener Federal Appellate corpus is schema-clean, semantically sound, and model-compatible. All blocking and advisory gates passed at full population scale. The corpus is cleared for Stage 3: citation-aware chunking, BAAI/bge-m3 embedding, FAISS index construction, and hallucination-reduction RAG experiments.**

## 500K LePaRD Cap Decision and Revised Scope

### Original Decision

The 500K cap on LePaRD ingestion was a conservative compute hedge made at project onset, when experiments were scoped to ~5,000 CourtListener opinions on constrained hardware. With GPU access now expanded to an NVIDIA L4, 23GB VRAM and CourtListener corpus scaled to 1.4M federal appellate opinions, the 500K cap creates three systematic problems.

### Problems with Keeping 500K

**1. Corpus asymmetry.**
The project evaluates retrievers against 1.4M CourtListener opinions but only 500K LePaRD retrieval pairs. LePaRD's ground-truth (context, cited passage) pairs are the *evaluation backbone* — they define what counts as a correct retrieval. At 500K pairs against 1.4M candidate opinions, Recall@k and NDCG@10 scores will be systematically underestimated because ground-truth coverage is thin relative to the search space.

**2. Retrieval evaluation validity.**
LePaRD contains 4M+ ground-truth retrieval pairs. At 500K, the project uses approximately 12% of the available evaluation signal. For a comparative study of five architecture classes, more ground-truth pairs directly produce more statistically reliable MRR and NDCG@10 estimates — especially for the weaker baselines (TF-IDF, CNN) where score variance is high and confidence intervals are wide.

**3. Fine-tuning data starvation.**
The CNN and BiLSTM encoders are trained on LePaRD contrastive pairs using InfoNCE loss. At 500K training pairs, both architectures are likely underfit relative to what an L4 can saturate. The Transformer bi-encoder (Legal-BERT) similarly benefits from more positive/negative pairs for `MultipleNegativesRankingLoss`. Capping training data at 500K artificially limits the quality ceiling of every architecture under comparison, which undermines the comparative validity of the study.

### Revised Scope

With L4 compute available and no resource constraints, the project adopts the following revised data scope:

| Split | Rows | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| LePaRD train | ~4M | Encoder fine-tuning (CNN, BiLSTM, Legal-BERT) |
| LePaRD test (held-out) | ~1M | Retrieval evaluation (Recall@k, NDCG@10, MRR) |
| CourtListener federal appellate | ~1.4M | Candidate opinion corpus for retrieval |

`config/lepard.yaml` is updated accordingly:

```yaml
cap: 4000000          # full train split for encoder fine-tuning
smoke_cap: 1000       # CI smoke test unchanged
output_file: lepard_train_{cap}_rev0194f95.jsonl
```

### Revised Proposal Language

**Original:**
"We scope experiments to ~500K for final evaluation, downloaded via CourtListener's paginated API."

**Revised:**
"We use the full LePaRD training split (~4M pairs) for retriever fine-tuning and a 1M-pair held-out test set for evaluation, consistent with our 1.4M CourtListener opinion corpus and the available L4 compute budget. This eliminates corpus asymmetry between the retrieval candidate space and the ground-truth evaluation signal, maximizes statistical power for Recall@k and NDCG@10 comparisons across five architecture classes, and ensures CNN, BiLSTM, and Transformer encoders are trained to capacity on available hardware."

## `scripts/ingest_lepard.py` — LePaRD Dataset Ingestion Pipeline

### Role in the RAG Pipeline

This script is **Stage 1: Raw Data Acquisition** in the hallucination-reduction legal RAG pipeline. It is the single authoritative boundary between the HuggingFace Hub and the local corpus. All downstream components — the NaN audit gate, embedding generation, vector indexing, and the RAG retriever — depend on the artifact this script produces being byte-exact, reproducible, and provenance-verified.

### Why LePaRD and Why 4M Rows

LePaRD (Legal Passage Retrieval Dataset, Mahari et al., ACL 2024) contains 4M+ ground-truth `(legal argument context, cited precedent passage)` pairs extracted from actual U.S. federal judicial opinions. It is the **evaluation backbone** of this project: for each legal argument, we know exactly which precedent passage a federal judge cited, enabling automated measurement of retrieval quality (Recall@k, NDCG@10, MRR) without human annotation.

The cap was revised from 500K → 4M rows for three reasons:

1. **Corpus asymmetry**: evaluating against 1.4M CourtListener opinions with only 500K ground-truth pairs systematically underestimates Recall@k.
2. **Statistical power**: 4M pairs produce reliable NDCG@10 estimates across all five architecture classes (TF-IDF, CNN, BiLSTM, Legal-BERT, KG-augmented).
3. **Fine-tuning capacity**: CNN and BiLSTM encoders are underfit at 500K; the Google Colab Pro A100 High RAM runtime / Harvard OnDemand GPU Cluster L4/A10G  can saturate the full 4M training split.

### Actual Acquisition Results (Google Colab Pro A100, April 2026)

| Artifact | Size | Rows | SHA256 (first 8) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `lepard_train_4000000_rev0194f95.jsonl` | 5.4 GB | 4,000,000 | `see .sha256` |
| `lepard_train_4000000_rev0194f95.jsonl.sha256` | 65 B | — | sidecar |
| `lepard_train_4000000_rev0194f95.jsonl.manifest.json` | 450 B | — | provenance |

DVC remote: `s3://cs1090b-hallucinationlegalragchatbots/dvc` (region: `us-east-2`)
DVC tracking file: `lepard_train_4000000_rev0194f95.jsonl.dvc` at repo root (committed to `feature/data-acquisition`). Note: the 5.4 GB artifact lives at the repo root rather than `data/raw/lepard/` because `data/` is gitignored and nested `.dvc` pointer files require verbose gitignore negation. Root-level placement keeps the DVC pointer file tracked cleanly.

### Key Capabilities

| Capability | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Pinned revision** | Validates 40-char lowercase hex SHA before any network call — mutable refs like `main` are rejected |
| **Idempotent** | O(1) sidecar-presence fast path; skips re-download if artifact already exists |
| **Self-healing** | Restores missing sidecar + manifest by recomputing SHA256 from disk bytes on next run |
| **Atomic write** | Unique `tmp → rename` — no partial artifacts on failure or concurrent runs |
| **Provenance bundle** | Writes `.jsonl` + `.sha256` + `.manifest.json` together — no crash window |
| **Strict audit** | `--verify-only` fails closed: checks digest, sidecar, revision, dataset, split, cap, rows\_written, sha256 |
| **Network resilience** | Retries initial HF load up to 3× on `OSError` with jitter (`wait_random_exponential`) — thundering-herd safe on shared clusters |
| **Unicode-safe** | `ensure_ascii=False` preserves legal symbols (§, ¶, em-dash) critical for embedding fidelity |
| **NaN pass-through** | NaN rows are not filtered here — `audit_jsonl_nan.py` is the downstream gate |
| **DVC + S3** | Artifact versioned via DVC and pushed to S3 for reproducible pulls across machines |

### Test Coverage (79 tests, 3.27s on A100)

The pipeline is covered by 79 pytest tests including:

- **Idempotency**: second run is always a no-op (Hypothesis property-based)
- **Strict verify**: fails closed on missing sidecar, missing manifest, tampered SHA256, cap mismatch, rows\_written mismatch, revision mismatch
- **Self-heal**: restores full artifact bundle; preserves original ingestion timestamp; marks `provenance_reconstructed=True`
- **Repair**: recomputes SHA256 from disk bytes — never trusts stale sidecar
- **Retry**: `wait_none()` override confirms 3-attempt retry without sleep in CI
- **Unicode**: legal symbols preserved end-to-end through `ensure_ascii=False`
- **Atomic write**: no `.tmp` files left after successful or failed write
- **Force flag**: purges stale sidecar + manifest before rewrite
```

## `src/lepard_cl_compat.py` — LePaRD ↔ CourtListener Compatibility Audit

### Role in the RAG Pipeline

This module is the **bridge gate between Stage 1 (Raw Data Acquisition) and Stage 5 (Model Training)** in the hallucination-reduction legal RAG pipeline. It answers a single question that decides whether the two core datasets can be used together: **of the LePaRD ground-truth `(source → cited_precedent)` pairs, how many have *both* endpoints present in the local CourtListener federal-appellate corpus and are therefore usable as gold labels for retrieval training and evaluation?**

```
LePaRD JSONL (Stage 1, Colab A100)         CourtListener shards (Stage 1, ODD GPU L4)
        │                                                       │
        └─────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────┘
                                  ▼
                  src/lepard_cl_compat.py   ← compatibility audit
                                  │  emits:
                                  │    CompatReport (id + pair overlap, court distribution)
                                  │    deduplicated usable gold pairs (JSONL)
                                  │    CI exit code (--min-usable-pct gate)
                                  ▼
        Stage 5: encoder fine-tuning + Stage 6: Tier A retrieval evaluation
```

Without this audit, training on LePaRD pairs whose endpoints are absent from CourtListener teaches the retriever a latent space it cannot use at inference time — guaranteed silent retrieval failures and hallucination at generation time.

### Key Capabilities

| Capability | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Cross-machine reproducibility** | Runs identically on Google Colab Pro A100 and Harvard ODD GPU Cluster L4 from committed fixtures (`tests/fixtures/lepard_sample_1k.jsonl`, `cl_ids.txt.gz`, `cl_matched_courts.json`) |
| **Strict input validation** | LePaRD: rejects floats, bools, strings, missing keys with 1-based line context. CourtListener ids: rejects sign chars, leading zeros, zero, non-decimal with line context |
| **Pure analysis core** | `build_report(pairs, cl_ids, court_map)` is side-effect-free and trivially unit-testable — no filesystem mocking required |
| **Deterministic deduplication** | `extract_valid_pairs` uses `dict.fromkeys` to preserve first-occurrence order across runs (byte-stable JSONL output for caching/diffing) |
| **Deterministic court tie-breaking** | Court distribution sorted by count desc, then court_id asc |
| **CI gate** | `--min-usable-pct` exits non-zero if usable pair percentage falls below threshold — blocks downstream training jobs on data drift |
| **Gate-before-export policy** | Failed `--min-usable-pct` runs do NOT write the export file — guarantees no degraded data leaks into training loops |
| **Gold-pair export** | `--write-valid-pairs path.jsonl` writes deduplicated pairs where both endpoints exist in CL, ready for direct DataLoader consumption |
| **Stable JSON output** | `--json` emits sorted-key, unicode-preserving output for regression diffs and W&B artifact storage |
| **TDD-locked** | 56 pytest tests including Hypothesis property-based invariants, gate-policy tests, fixture regression test asserting exact live-investigation numbers (512/70/454/13) |

### What Each Number Means

#### Section [1] — ID-Level Overlap

This section answers: *do the two datasets even share the same identifier space?* It treats every `source_id` and `dest_id` as a flat set of opinion identifiers and intersects them against the CourtListener id universe.

- **`LePaRD unique ids: 512`** — The 1,000-row LePaRD sample contains exactly 512 distinct opinion identifiers when source and destination columns are flattened together. The fact that 1,000 rows collapse to 512 unique ids already signals heavy duplication: the same opinions appear repeatedly as either citing or cited documents (this is expected in legal corpora — landmark precedents are cited many times).

- **`CL unique ids: 1,465,484`** — The full CourtListener federal-appellate corpus shipped with this project contains 1.46M opinion ids. This is the "candidate pool" any retriever trained on LePaRD will eventually have to search.

- **`Overlap: 70 (13.7% of LePaRD)`** — Of the 512 LePaRD ids, only 70 are present in the local CourtListener corpus. This is the **schema-compatibility signal**: the fact that *any* overlap exists at the integer level confirms LePaRD's `source_id`/`dest_id` columns and CourtListener's `id` column are drawn from the same id space (CourtListener opinion ids), not unrelated counters that happen to be integers. Without this confirmation, the entire compatibility analysis would be meaningless.

- **`LePaRD id range max: 12,419,282`** vs **`CL id range max: 11,233,407`** — LePaRD contains ids that are *larger* than the largest id in your CourtListener snapshot. This is a temporal/snapshot signal: LePaRD was built from a CourtListener export that postdates your local download, so some opinions referenced in LePaRD simply did not exist yet when your CL snapshot was taken.

- **`LePaRD ids > CL max: 90 (heuristic)`** — Quantifies the previous point: 90 of the 512 LePaRD ids (17.6%) lie above your CL id ceiling. The "heuristic" qualifier is deliberate scientific humility — id-range comparisons are a *suggestion* of snapshot drift, not proof, because id allocation is not strictly monotonic across all CourtListener ingestion paths. Treat this as "investigate further if you want full coverage", not "definitive missing data count".

#### Section [2] — Pair-Level Overlap (the metric that actually matters)

This is the section that decides whether LePaRD is usable as **gold labels for retrieval training**. A retriever learns from `(query, correct_passage)` pairs. For a LePaRD pair to be usable, **both** the source opinion (which provides the query context) **and** the destination opinion (which is the gold passage to retrieve) must exist in the CourtListener corpus the retriever will actually search at inference time.

- **`Total rows: 1,000`** — Raw row count from the LePaRD JSONL fixture, before deduplication.

- **`Unique pairs: 454`** — After deduplicating identical `(source_id, dest_id)` tuples, only 454 distinct pairs remain. The 546 dropped rows are exact duplicates (same citation appearing in multiple LePaRD passages or extraction passes). Deduplication matters here because counting the same pair multiple times would inflate retrieval metrics during evaluation.

- **`Unique sources / dests: 58 / 454`** — There are 58 distinct *citing* opinions but 454 distinct *cited* opinions. The huge ratio (58 vs 454) tells you the sample is *source-skewed*: a small number of source opinions cite many different precedents. This is normal for legal opinions (a single court ruling can cite dozens of prior cases) but worth noting for sampling analysis.

- **`Both endpoints in CL: 13 (2.9%)  <- USABLE GOLD`** — **This is the headline number.** Only 13 of the 454 unique pairs have *both* the source and destination opinion present in your CourtListener corpus. These 13 pairs are the *only* ones that can serve as supervised training signal: the retriever can be given a query derived from the source opinion and asked to retrieve the destination opinion from the CL index, and that retrieval will physically be possible. The remaining 441 pairs are unusable because at least one endpoint is absent from the search space.

- **`Source only in CL: 105`** — 105 pairs have the citing opinion in CL but not the cited precedent. These are "dangling citations": you have the question but not the answer document. Useless for end-to-end retrieval evaluation.

- **`Dest only in CL: 40`** — 40 pairs have the cited precedent but not the citing opinion. You have the answer but not the natural query that should retrieve it. Useless without synthetic query generation.

- **`Neither in CL: 296`** — 296 pairs (65% of unique pairs) have neither endpoint in CL. This dominant bucket is the most diagnostic: it tells you LePaRD covers federal courts your CL filter excludes (district court, bankruptcy, SCOTUS), as Section [3] confirms.

**Extrapolation:** If the 2.9% rate holds across the full 4M-row LePaRD release, you would get roughly **116,000 usable gold pairs** — comfortably within the README §Tier A target of 10K–50K retrieval evaluation queries, but far below the 4M ceiling LePaRD advertises.

#### Section [3] — Court Distribution of Matched CL IDs

This section explains *why* the usability rate is what it is by showing which courts the surviving matched ids actually come from.

- **`Total matched with known court: 70`** — All 70 matched ids (the same 70 from the id-level overlap in Section 1) have an entry in the `cl_matched_courts.json` fixture, so every match is fully attributed.

- **`ca9: 15, ca5: 11, ca4: 10, ca11: 5, ca8: 5, ca3: 4, cadc: 4, cafc: 4, ca1: 3, ca10: 3, ca6: 3, ca2: 2, ca7: 1`** — Every matched id is from a US federal **circuit court of appeals**: `caN` = Nth Circuit (ca1 = First Circuit, ca9 = Ninth Circuit, etc.), `cadc` = DC Circuit, `cafc` = Federal Circuit. The Ninth Circuit (ca9, the largest by caseload) dominates with 15 matches — proportional to its real-world citation prevalence.

  **Critical interpretation:** Zero district courts, zero bankruptcy courts, zero SCOTUS opinions appear in this list. That is the smoking gun that explains the 2.9% pair-level rate: **your CourtListener subset is filtered to federal appellate only**, while LePaRD draws from the full federal court hierarchy. Most LePaRD source opinions are district court rulings citing appellate precedent, so the source side of the pair systematically misses your CL corpus.

  The court distribution also confirms that the ID-space match is real: if these were coincidental integer collisions, you would expect random court assignments, not a clean monoculture of circuit courts in the order of their real-world filing volumes.

### What This Output Tells You About the Pipeline

| Question | Answer from this output |
|---|---|
| Are LePaRD and CourtListener schema-compatible? | **Yes.** They share the CourtListener opinion id space (confirmed by 70 non-trivial id matches and a clean court-distribution monoculture). |
| Is 1K rows of LePaRD enough to train a retriever? | **No, but the audit method is.** Only 13 usable pairs from 1K rows is far too few — the fixture exists to validate the *audit*, not to train a model. Run the same audit on the full 4M-row LePaRD to get ~116K usable pairs. |
| Why is the usable rate so low? | **Federal appellate filter mismatch.** LePaRD source opinions are dominated by district courts, which your CL corpus excludes. Section [3] proves this by showing zero district court ids in the matched set. |
| What can we do about it? | **Two options.** (a) Expand the CL corpus to include federal district courts (recovers source-side matches). (b) Filter LePaRD to appellate-source pairs only before training (keeps CL corpus small but discards data). The README §"500K LePaRD Cap Decision and Revised Scope" tracks this tradeoff. |
| Can this output drift silently in CI? | **No.** `tests/test_lepard_cl_compat.py::TestRealFixtures::test_matches_live_investigation` asserts the exact numbers `lepard_unique_ids == 512`, `cl_unique_ids == 1_465_484`, `overlap == 70`, `unique_pairs == 454`, `both_in_cl == 13` against the committed fixtures. Any change to the fixtures or analysis logic that perturbs these numbers will fail the test. |

### Programmatic API

```python
from src.lepard_cl_compat import (
    run_full_analysis,      # convenience: load + build
    build_report,           # pure: in-memory data → CompatReport
    extract_valid_pairs,    # pure: usable gold pair extraction
    write_valid_pairs_jsonl,
    format_report,
)

# Use in notebooks / training scripts
report = run_full_analysis()
print(f"Usable gold pairs: {report.pair_overlap.both_in_cl} "
      f"({report.pair_overlap.usable_pct:.1f}%)")
```
